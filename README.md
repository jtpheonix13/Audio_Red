# Audio Red

AudioRed is a new platform to allow users to have a fresh display to their music interests as well as link them to the user's spotify in order to listen to their favorite tunes.

By combining the Spotify API, Tailwind CSS framework, Handlebars.JS, and a Social Media ideaology into one idea, AudioRed was created with a fresh and updated User Interface.

To use this program, a user must create a secure account that will link to their respective Spotify account. The program then uses their data to populate the AudioRed interface with Spotify's trending songs, the user's playlists, album covers, top music, and more!

At the current moment, to listen to your favorite music you can use AudioRed to travel directly to Spotify's Media player and listen to the requested songs and playlists.

Technologies Used :
Tailwind CSS, Sequelize, Spotify API, MVC, Handlebars, Node.js
